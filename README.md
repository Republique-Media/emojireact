# EmojiReact

EmojiReact is a site I created in 2016 as a way to quickly add emoji reactions
(similar to that of Facebook, Slack and many other sites) to your own sites.

It does this by embedding an iframe onto your page to a unique page, set by
the javascript snippet to use the URL of the current page.

It has been a "Cloudflare App" not long after I launched the site which has
made the site go up to **5M requests a month** which is insane :tada:

## Why am I open sourcing this?

1. I've had a couple of requests to do so.
2. The site runs slow with 5M requests and could do with some tweaking
3. GDPR may require me to close the site
